            It's chilled & light-filled during the day. You could bring your
            laptop and work over a Reuben sandwhich (they're good, trust me). I
            get the feeling staff wouldn't mind if you snuck your dog upstairs
            into the beer garden.

            Down an alley that's filled with graffiti art, in the 🖤 of
            Footscray (Nicholson St mall), above a vinyl shop/cafe and some of
            the best pizza in
            <span class="strikethrough">the West</span> Melbourne (hi Slice
            Shop). Seems like at night, based on their Facebook pics and lineup
            of DJs, it's a pretty busy place too.
