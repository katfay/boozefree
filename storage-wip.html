      Making life after booze more fun. Ever feel that awkward bloke who'll
      "just have a coke, thanks" ruining your best mate's bucks party? Same.
      Maybe you don't booze because your doctor told you about an early grave.
      Maybe it's because you just don't want to any more. Maybe it's because you
      turn into a total psycho who starts sobbing and throws all your
      housemate's shoes off the balcony. Who really cares? The point is, you've
      decided not to drink today, tomorrow, forever, whatever. And you don't
      want to feel like an awkward arsehole for deciding it. But my gosh, you
      will. So on this page we'll list some of our ways of adjusting to life
      after booze without feeling like a slab of beige chalk.

      Your reasons for choosing a non-alcoholic drink don't really matter. But
      being told, 'We have softdrinks, or water ðŸ˜ƒ' [wow, <em>thanks</em>!!!]
      does. Skip the cringe and grab your next meal at these restaurants, bars
      and cafes. We've been to each one, and they don't consign you to the kids'
      table with a glass of Coke.

      Or, check out the bottle-o's. They stock at least one type of
      non-alcoholic beer. Hooray, your Friday night takeaway can feel a little
      more 'grown up' again! Hooray, you can go to a party or bbq without having
      to choose between downing a kilogram of liquid sugar, or soda water ...
      again!

      Here's Melbourne's first and
      <a href="https://brunswickaces.com/">best non-alcoholic bar</a>, by the
      way. You're welcome.
